As a part of a workflow we need to parse the contents of the given 'input.txt' file.

The file contains multi-line chuncks of information separated by an empty new line.
Each chunck has a formatting like
	# {Name} [{Description}]
	# area (lat: {MinLat}, {MaxLat}) - (lon: {MinLon}, {MaxLon}) [...]
	# {DeprecatedOrDiscontinued}
	<{Identity}> {ProjValue} <>
Note how the bracket pairs used above mark the text extent of each data field we are interested in.

Implement a class that can be passed a string parameter, i.e. like the input file contents, 
parse the text and produce the following column output
	{Identity} {Name} {Description} {MinLat} {MaxLat} {MinLon} {MaxLon} {ProjValue} {DeprecatedOrDiscontinued}

Each chunk should populate a single output row.
{DeprecatedOrDiscontinued} field will be empty if not present in the input.

Provide a Unit test assembly or any other solution that will facilitate running the implemented source code.
You can use any nuget package and/or non-proprietary 3rd party library desired, 
as long as you explain the reasoning behind selecting it.

Your code should be consice, containing comments, and be sufficiently documented in any way you see fit.
